# Fluence

![docs/images/fluence.png](docs/images/fluence.png)

Fluence enables HPC-grade pod scheduling in Kubernetes via the [Kubernetes Scheduling Framework](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/scheduling-framework/). Fluence uses the directed-graph based [Fluxion scheduler](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-sched) to map pods or [podgroups](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/scheduler-plugins/tree/master/pkg/coscheduling) to nodes. Fluence supports all the Fluxion scheduling algorithms (e.g., `hi`, `low`, `hinode`, etc.). Note that Fluence does not currently support use in conjunction with the kube-scheduler. Pods must all be scheduled by Fluence.

## Getting started

For instructions on how to start Fluence on a K8s cluster, see [examples](examples/). Documentation and instructions for reproducing our CANOPIE2022 paper (citation below) can be found in the [canopie22-artifacts branch](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-k8s/tree/canopie22-artifacts).
For background on the Flux framework and the Fluxion scheduler, you can take a look at our award-winning R&D100 submission: https://ipo.llnl.gov/sites/default/files/2022-02/Flux_RD100_Final.pdf. For next steps:

 - To understand how it works, see [Design](#design)
 - To deploy our pre-built images, go to [Deploy](#deploy)
 - To build your own images, go to [Setup](#setup)
 - To learn about repository organization, see [Developer](#developer)

### Design

Fluence is a custom scheduler plugin that you can specify to use with two directive in your pod spec -

- Asking for `fluence` as the scheduler name
- Defining a named group of pods with the `fluence.flux-framework.org/pod-group` label. 
- Defining the group size with the `fluence.flux-framework.org/group-size` label. 

If you are using Fluence, these values are required.
An example is shown below for an indexed job, which will create multiple pods.

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: fluence-job
  annotations:
    fluence.flux-framework.org/pod-group: my-pods
    fluence.flux-framework.org/group-size: 10
spec:
  completions: 10
  parallelism: 10
  completionMode: Indexed
  template:
    spec:
      schedulerName: fluence
      containers:
      - name: fluence-job
        image: busybox
        command: [echo, potato]
      restartPolicy: Never
  backoffLimit: 4
```

The group size might be different than, for example, your higher level abstraction (e.g., the IndexedJob) as there is no reason
pods with different names cannot be part of the same group that needs to be scheduled together.

### Deploy

We provide a set of pre-build containers [alongside the repository](https://github.com/orgs/flux-framework/packages?repo_name=flux-k8s)
that you can easily use to deploy Fluence right away! You'll simply need to clone the proper helm charts, and then install to your cluster.
We provide helper commands to do that.

```bash
# This clones the upstream scheduler plugins code, we will add fluence to it!
make prepare

# Add fluence assets
cd upstream/manifests/install/charts
helm install \
  --set scheduler.image=ghcr.io/flux-framework/fluence:latest \
  --set scheduler.sidecarimage=ghcr.io/flux-framework/fluence-sidecar \
    schedscheduler-plugins as-a-second-scheduler/
```

And that's it! See the [testing install](#testing-install) section for a basic example
to schedule pods using Fluence.

### Setup

To build and test Fluence, you will need:

 - [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install), we have tested with version 1.19
 - [helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) to install charts for scheduler plugins.
 - A Kubernetes cluster for testing, e.g., you can deploy one with [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/)

### Building Fluence

There are two images we will be building:

 - the scheduler sidecar: built from the repository here
 - the scheduler: built from [this branch of scheduler-plugins](https://github.com/openshift-psap/scheduler-plugins/blob/fluence/build/scheduler/Dockerfile)

#### All at once (Sidecar + Scheduler)

**recommended**

This will run the full builds for all containers in one step, which includes:

1. Building the fluence sidecar from source code in [src](src)
2. Cloning the upstream kubernetes-sigs/plugin-schedulers respository to ./upstream
3. Building the scheduler container

From the root here:

```bash
make
```

or customize the naming of your registry or local images:

```bash
make REGISTRY=vanessa SCHEDULER_IMAGE=fluence SIDECAR_IMAGE=fluence-sidecar
```

As an alternative, you can do each of the steps separately or manually (detailed below).

<details>

<summary> Manual Build Instructions </summary>

#### Build Sidecar

To build the plugin containers, we will basically be running `make` from the [src](src) directory. We have wrapped that for you
in the Makefile:

```bash
make build-sidecar
```

To build for a custom registry (e.g., "vanessa' on Docker Hub):

```bash
make build-sidecar REGISTRY=vanessa
```

And specify the sidecar image name too:

```bash
make build-sidecar REGISTRY=vanessa SIDECAR_IMAGE=another-sidecar
```

The equivalent manual command is:

```bash
cd src
make
```

Using either of the approaches above, this will create the scheduler plugin main container, which can be tagged and pushed to the preferred registry. As an example,
here we push to the result of the build above:

```bash
docker push docker.io/vanessa/fluence-sidecar:latest
```

#### Build Scheduler

Note that you can run this entire process like:

```bash
make prepare
make build
```

Or customize the name of the scheduler image:

```bash
make prepare
make build REGISTRY=vanessa
```

For a custom scheduler or controller image (we just need the scheduler):

```bash
make build REGISTRY=vanessa CONTROLLER_IMAGE=fluence-controller SCHEDULER_IMAGE=fluence
```

To walk through it manually, first, clone the upstream scheduler-plugins repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/scheduler-plugins ./upstream
```

We need to add our fluence package to the scheduler plugins to build. You can do that manully as follows:

```bash
# These are entirely new directory structures
cp -R sig-scheduler-plugins/pkg/fluence ./upstream/pkg/fluence
cp -R sig-scheduler-plugins/manifests/fluence ./upstream/manifests/fluence

# These are files with subtle changes to add fluence
cp sig-scheduler-plugins/cmd/scheduler/main.go ./upstream/cmd/scheduler/main.go
cp sig-scheduler-plugins/manifests/install/charts/as-a-second-scheduler/templates/deployment.yaml ./upstream/manifests/install/charts/as-a-second-scheduler/templates/deployment.yaml
cp sig-scheduler-plugins/manifests/install/charts/as-a-second-scheduler/values.yaml ./upstream/manifests/install/charts/as-a-second-scheduler/values.yaml
```

Then change directory to the scheduler plugins repository. 

```bash
cd ./upstream
```

And build! You'll most likely want to set a custom registry and image name again:

```bash
# This will build to localhost
make local-image

# this will build to docker.io/vanessa/fluence
make local-image REGISTRY=vanessa CONTROLLER_IMAGE=fluence
```

</details>

**Important** the make command above produces _two images_ and you want to use the first that is mentioned in the output (not the second, which is a controller).

Whatever build approach you use, you'll want to push to your registry for later discovery!

```bash
docker push docker.io/vanessa/fluence
```

### Prepare Cluster

> Prepare a cluster and install the Kubernetes scheduling plugins framework

These steps will require a Kubernetes cluster to install to, and having pushed the plugin container to a registry. If you aren't using a cloud provider, you can create a local one with `kind`:

```bash
kind create cluster
```

**Important** if you are developing or testing fluence, note that custom scheduler plugins don't seem to work out of the box with MiniKube (but everything works with kind). Likely there are extensions or similar that need to be configured with MiniKube (that we have not looked into).

### Install Fluence

For some background, the [Scheduling Framework](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/scheduling-framework/) provided by
Kubernetes means that our container is going to provide specific endpoints to allow for custom scheduling. At this point you can follow the instructions
under [deploy](#deploy) to ensure you have cloned the upstream kubernetes-sigs/scheduler-plugins and installed fluence. This section will provide
more details to inspect attributes available to you. Let's say that you ran

```bash
make prepare
```

You could then inspect values with helm:

```bash
cd upstream/manifests/install/charts
helm show values as-a-second-scheduler/
```

<details>

<summary>Helm values for as-a-second-scheduler</summary>

```console
# Default values for scheduler-plugins-as-a-second-scheduler.
# This is a YAML-formatted file.
# Declare variables to be passed into your templates.

scheduler:
  name: fluence
  image: registry.k8s.io/scheduler-plugins/kube-scheduler:v0.27.8
  replicaCount: 1
  leaderElect: false
  sidecarimage: ghcr.io/flux-framework/fluence-sidecar:latest
  policy: lonode
  pullPolicy: Always
  sidecarPullPolicy: Always

controller:
  name: scheduler-plugins-controller
  image: registry.k8s.io/scheduler-plugins/controller:v0.27.8
  replicaCount: 1
  pullPolicy: IfNotPresent

# LoadVariationRiskBalancing and TargetLoadPacking are not enabled by default
# as they need extra RBAC privileges on metrics.k8s.io.

plugins:
  enabled: ["Fluence"]
  disabled: ["CapacityScheduling","NodeResourceTopologyMatch","NodeResourcesAllocatable","PrioritySort","Coscheduling"] # only in-tree plugins need to be defined here

# Customize the enabled plugins' config.
# Refer to the "pluginConfig" section of manifests/<plugin>/scheduler-config.yaml.
# For example, for Coscheduling plugin, you want to customize the permit waiting timeout to 10 seconds:
pluginConfig:
- name: Coscheduling
  args:
    permitWaitingTimeSeconds: 10 # default is 60
# Or, customize the other plugins
# - name: NodeResourceTopologyMatch
#   args:
#     scoringStrategy:
#       type: MostAllocated # default is LeastAllocated
```

</details>

Note that this plugin is going to allow us to create a Deployment with our plugin to be used as a scheduler!
The `helm install` shown under [deploy](#deploy) is how you can install to your cluster, and then proceed to testing below. Here would be an example using custom images:

```bash
cd upstream/manifests/install/charts
helm install \
  --set scheduler.image=vanessa/fluence:latest \
  --set scheduler.sidecarimage=vanessa/fluence-sidecar \
    schedscheduler-plugins as-a-second-scheduler/
```

If you load your images into your testing environment and don't need to pull, you can change the pull policy too:

```bash
helm install \
  --set scheduler.image=vanessa/fluence:latest \
  --set scheduler.sidecarimage=vanessa/fluence-sidecar \
  --set scheduler.sidecarPullPolicy=IfNotPresent \
    schedscheduler-plugins as-a-second-scheduler/
```

If you need to uninstall (e.g., to redo something):

```bash
helm uninstall schedscheduler-plugins
```

Next you can move down to testing the install.

### Testing Install

The installation process will run one scheduler and one controller pod for the Scheduler Plugin Framework in the default namespace.
You can double check that everything is running as follows:

```bash
kubectl get pods
```
```console
NAME                                            READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
fluence-6bbcbc6bbf-xjfx6                        2/2     Running   0          2m35s
scheduler-plugins-controller-787757d8b8-ss5qv   1/1     Running   0          2m35s
```

Wait until the pods are running! You've just deployed Fluence, congratulations!
Let's now check logs for containers to check that everything is OK.
First, let's look at logs for the sidecar container:

```bash
kubectl logs fluence-6bbcbc6bbf-xjfx6 
```
```console
Defaulted container "sidecar" out of: sidecar, scheduler-plugins-scheduler
This is the fluxion grpc server
Created flux resource client  &{0x3bd33d0}
&{ctx:0x3bd33d0}
Number nodes  1
node in flux group  kind-control-plane
Node  kind-control-plane  flux cpu  10
Node  kind-control-plane  total mem  32992821248
Can request at most  10  exclusive cpu
Match policy:  {"matcher_policy": "lonode"}
[GRPCServer] gRPC Listening on [::]:4242
```

And for the fluence container:

```bash
kubectl logs fluence-6bbcbc6bbf-xjfx6 -c scheduler-plugins-scheduler
```

If you haven't done anything, you'll likely just see health checks.

### Deploy Pods

Let's now run a simple example! Change directory into this directory:

```bash
# This is from the root of flux-k8s
cd examples/simple_example
```

And then we want to deploy two pods, one assigned to the `default-scheduler` and the other
`fluence`. For FYI, we do this via setting `schedulerName` in the spec:

```yaml
spec:
  schedulerName: fluence
```

Here is how to create the pods:

```bash
kubectl apply -f default-scheduler-pod.yaml
kubectl apply -f fluence-scheduler-pod.yaml
```

Once it was created, aside from checking that it ran OK, I could verify by looking at the scheduler logs again:

```bash
kubectl logs fluence-6bbcbc6bbf-xjfx6
```
```bash
Defaulted container "sidecar" out of: sidecar, scheduler-plugins-scheduler
This is the fluxion grpc server
Created cli context  &{}

I was trying to look for a way to see the assignment, and maybe we can see it here (this is the best I could come up with!)

```bash
kubectl get events -o wide
```
```bash
kubectl get events -o wide |  awk {'print $4" " $5" " $6'} | column -t
```
```console
REASON                     OBJECT                                        SUBOBJECT

pod/default-scheduler-pod  spec.containers{default-scheduler-container}  kubelet,
pod/default-scheduler-pod  spec.containers{default-scheduler-container}  kubelet,
pod/default-scheduler-pod  spec.containers{default-scheduler-container}  kubelet,
pod/default-scheduler-pod  spec.containers{default-scheduler-container}  kubelet,
pod/fluence-scheduled-pod  fluence,                                      fluence-fluence-6bbcbc6bbf-xjfx6
pod/fluence-scheduled-pod  spec.containers{fluence-scheduled-container}  kubelet,
pod/fluence-scheduled-pod  spec.containers{fluence-scheduled-container}  kubelet,
pod/fluence-scheduled-pod  spec.containers{fluence-scheduled-container}  kubelet,
...
```

For the above, I found [this page](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/configure-multiple-schedulers/#enable-leader-election) very helpful.

Finally, note that we also have a more appropriate example with jobs under [examples/test_example](examples/test_example). It's slightly more sane because it uses Job, and jobs are expected to complete (whereas pods are not and will get into crash loop backoffs, etc). For example of how to programmatically interact with the job pods and check states, events, see the [test.sh](.github/test.sh) script.

### Developer

You can see [deploy](#deploy) for instructions on how to do a custom deployment. 

#### Organization

If you are looking to develop:

 - [src](src): includes source code for fluence. You'll find logs for this code in the `sidecar` container of the fluence pod.
 - [sig-scheduler-plugins](sig-scheduler-plugins): includes assets (manifests and Go files) that are intended to be added to the kubernetes-sigs/scheduler-plugins upstream repository before build. You'll find logs for this container in the `scheduler-plugins-scheduler` container of the pod.
   - [manifests](sig-scheduler-plugins/manifests): manifests for helm and Kubernetes
   - [pkg](sig-scheduler-plugins/pkg): the main fluence module to add to upstream
   - [cmd](sig-scheduler-plugins/cmd): the main.go to replace in upstream
 - *upstream*: the default name this upstream is cloned to when you do a make build command.

Note that the clone of the repository and copying of files to the correct locations is all automated through the [Makefile](Makefile). Additional commands provided include the following:

```bash
# Only clone the repository into ./upstream
make clone

# Update the cloned upstream with a git pull origin master
make update
```

It's recommend to update once in a while if you have an older clone locally and there might be changes you are not accounting for.

#### GRPC

The fluence module uses GRPC to communicate with Flux, and these assets are stored in [src/fluence/fluxcli-grpc](src/fluence/fluxcli-grpc).
You should *only* update the [sig-scheduler-plugins/pkg/fluence/fluxcli-grpc/fluxcli.proto](src/fluence/fluxcli-grpc/fluxcli.proto) file,
and then from the root run `make proto` to re-generate the other files:

```bash
cd src

# Install protoc tools to local bin
# make protoc
make proto
```

#### Workflow

The easiest thing to do is to build the containers in some container namespace that you control (meaning you can push to a registry), e.g.,:

```bash
make build REGISTRY=ghcr.io/vsoch
```

And then install with your custom images:

```
cd ./upstream/manifests/install/charts
helm install \
  --set scheduler.image=ghcr.io/vsoch/fluence:latest \
  --set scheduler.sidecarimage=ghcr.io/vsoch/fluence-sidecar:latest \
        schedscheduler-plugins as-a-second-scheduler/
```

And then apply what you need to test, and look at logs! 
And then keep doing that until you get what you want :) Note that I haven't found a good way for the VSCode developer tools to work because we develop fluence outside of the tree it's supposed to be in.

#### Components

 - [FluxStateData](sig-scheduler-plugins/pkg/fluence/core/core.go): is given to the [framework.CycleState](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/242b41b36a20032f99e8a059ca0a5d764105217b/pkg/scheduler/framework/cycle_state.go#L48) and serves as a vehicle to store a cache of node name assignment.


#### Helm

The install commands are shown above, but often you want to uninstall!

> What is the name of the installed plugin again?

```bash
 helm list
NAME                    NAMESPACE       REVISION        UPDATED                                 STATUS          CHART                   APP VERSION
schedscheduler-plugins  default         1               2024-01-08 12:04:58.558612156 -0700 MST deployed        scheduler-plugins-0.27.80.27.8     
```

And then uninstall:

```bash
$ helm uninstall schedscheduler-plugins
release "schedscheduler-plugins" uninstalled
```
