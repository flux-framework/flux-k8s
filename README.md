# Fluence

![docs/images/fluence.png](docs/images/fluence.png)

Fluence enables HPC-grade pod scheduling in Kubernetes via the [Kubernetes Scheduling Framework](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/scheduling-framework/). Fluence uses the directed-graph based [Fluxion scheduler](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-sched) to map pods or [podgroups](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/scheduler-plugins/tree/master/pkg/coscheduling) to nodes. Fluence supports all the Fluxion scheduling algorithms (e.g., `hi`, `low`, `hinode`, etc.). 

**Important** Fluence does not currently support use in conjunction with the kube-scheduler. Pods must all be scheduled by Fluence, and *you should not use both schedulers in the same cluster*.

## Getting started

For instructions on how to start Fluence on a K8s cluster, see [examples](examples/). Documentation and instructions for reproducing our CANOPIE-2022 paper (citation below) can be found in the [canopie22-artifacts branch](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-k8s/tree/canopie22-artifacts).
For background on the Flux framework and the Fluxion scheduler, you can take a look at our award-winning R&D100 submission: https://ipo.llnl.gov/sites/default/files/2022-02/Flux_RD100_Final.pdf. For next steps:

 - To understand how it works, see [Design](#design)
 - To deploy our pre-built images, go to [Deploy](#deploy)
 - To build your own images, go to [Setup](#setup)
 - To learn about repository organization, see [Developer](#developer)

### Design

Fluence is a custom scheduler plugin that you can specify to use with two directive in your pod spec -

- Asking for `fluence` as the scheduler name
- Defining a named group of pods with the `fluence.flux-framework.org/pod-group` label. 
- Defining the group size with the `fluence.flux-framework.org/group-size` label. 

If you are using Fluence, these values are required.
An example is shown below for an indexed job, which will create multiple pods.

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: fluence-job
  annotations:
    fluence.flux-framework.org/pod-group: my-pods
    fluence.flux-framework.org/group-size: 10
spec:
  completions: 10
  parallelism: 10
  completionMode: Indexed
  template:
    spec:
      schedulerName: fluence
      containers:
      - name: fluence-job
        image: busybox
        command: [echo, potato]
      restartPolicy: Never
  backoffLimit: 4
```

The group size might be different than, for example, your higher level abstraction (e.g., the IndexedJob) as there is no reason
pods with different names cannot be part of the same group that needs to be scheduled together.

### Deploy

We provide a set of pre-build containers [alongside the repository](https://github.com/orgs/flux-framework/packages?repo_name=flux-k8s)
that you can easily use to deploy Fluence right away! You'll first need to install the certificate manager:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.13.1/cert-manager.yaml
```

And then clone the proper helm charts, and then install to your cluster. We provide helper commands to do that.

```bash
# This clones the upstream scheduler plugins code, we will add fluence to it!
make prepare

# Add fluence assets
cd upstream/manifests/install/charts
helm install \
  --set scheduler.image=ghcr.io/flux-framework/fluence:latest \
  --set scheduler.sidecarimage=ghcr.io/flux-framework/fluence-sidecar \
  --set controller.image=ghcr.io/flux-framework/fluence-controller \
    fluence as-a-second-scheduler/
```

And that's it! See the [testing install](#testing-install) section for a basic example
to schedule pods using Fluence.

### Setup

To build and test Fluence, you will need:

 - [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install), we have tested with version 1.19
 - [helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) to install charts for scheduler plugins.
 - A Kubernetes cluster for testing, e.g., you can deploy one with [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/)

### Building Fluence

There are two images we will be building:

 - the scheduler sidecar: built from the repository here
 - the scheduler: built (and modified) from [this branch of scheduler-plugins](https://github.com/openshift-psap/scheduler-plugins/blob/fluence/build/scheduler/Dockerfile)
 - the controller: same as the scheduler

#### Build All

**This builds the scheduler, sidecar to the scheduler, and controller**

This will run the full builds for all containers in one step, which includes:

1. Building the fluence sidecar from source code in [src](src)
2. Cloning the upstream kubernetes-sigs/plugin-schedulers respository to ./upstream
3. Building the scheduler and controller containers

From the root here:

```bash
make
```

or customize the naming of your registry or local images:

```bash
make REGISTRY=vanessa SCHEDULER_IMAGE=fluence SIDECAR_IMAGE=fluence-sidecar CONTROLLER_IMAGE=fluence-controller
```

As an alternative, you can look at the Makefile to do each of the steps separately.


Whatever build approach you use, you'll want to push to your registry for later discovery!

```bash
docker push docker.io/vanessa/fluence
docker push docker.io/vanessa/fluence-sidecar
docker push docker.io/vanessa/fluence-controller
```

### Prepare Cluster

> Prepare a cluster and install the Kubernetes scheduling plugins framework

These steps will require a Kubernetes cluster to install to, and having pushed the plugin container to a registry. If you aren't using a cloud provider, you can create a local one with `kind`:

```bash
kind create cluster --config ./examples/kind-config.yaml
```

And install the certificate manager:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.13.1/cert-manager.yaml
```

**Important** if you are developing or testing fluence, note that custom scheduler plugins don't seem to work out of the box with MiniKube (but everything works with kind). Likely there are extensions or similar that need to be configured with MiniKube (that we have not looked into).

### Install Fluence

For some background, the [Scheduling Framework](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/scheduling-framework/) provided by
Kubernetes means that our container is going to provide specific endpoints to allow for custom scheduling. At this point you can follow the instructions
under [deploy](#deploy) to ensure you have cloned the upstream kubernetes-sigs/scheduler-plugins and installed fluence. This section will provide
more details to inspect attributes available to you. Let's say that you ran

```bash
make prepare
```

You could then inspect values with helm:

```bash
cd upstream/manifests/install/charts
helm show values as-a-second-scheduler/
```

<details>

<summary>Helm values for as-a-second-scheduler</summary>

```console
# Default values for scheduler-plugins-as-a-second-scheduler.
# This is a YAML-formatted file.
# Declare variables to be passed into your templates.

scheduler:
  name: fluence
  image: registry.k8s.io/scheduler-plugins/kube-scheduler:v0.27.8
  replicaCount: 1
  leaderElect: false
  sidecarimage: ghcr.io/flux-framework/fluence-sidecar:latest
  policy: lonode
  pullPolicy: Always
  sidecarPullPolicy: Always

controller:
  name: scheduler-plugins-controller
  image: ghcr.io/flux-framework/fluence-controller:latest
  replicaCount: 1
  pullPolicy: IfNotPresent

# LoadVariationRiskBalancing and TargetLoadPacking are not enabled by default
# as they need extra RBAC privileges on metrics.k8s.io.

plugins:
  enabled: ["Fluence"]
  disabled: ["CapacityScheduling","NodeResourceTopologyMatch","NodeResourcesAllocatable","PrioritySort","Coscheduling"] # only in-tree plugins need to be defined here

# Customize the enabled plugins' config.
# Refer to the "pluginConfig" section of manifests/<plugin>/scheduler-config.yaml.
# For example, for Coscheduling plugin, you want to customize the permit waiting timeout to 10 seconds:
pluginConfig:
- name: Coscheduling
  args:
    permitWaitingTimeSeconds: 10 # default is 60
# Or, customize the other plugins
# - name: NodeResourceTopologyMatch
#   args:
#     scoringStrategy:
#       type: MostAllocated # default is LeastAllocated
```

</details>

Note that this plugin is going to allow us to create a Deployment with our plugin to be used as a scheduler!
The `helm install` shown under [deploy](#deploy) is how you can install to your cluster, and then proceed to testing below. Here would be an example using custom images:

```bash
cd upstream/manifests/install/charts
helm install \
  --set scheduler.image=vanessa/fluence:latest \
  --set scheduler.sidecarimage=vanessa/fluence-sidecar \
  --set controller.image=vanessa/fluence-controller \
    fluence as-a-second-scheduler/
```

If you load your images into your testing environment and don't need to pull, you can change the pull policy too:

```bash
helm install \
  --set scheduler.image=vanessa/fluence:latest \
  --set scheduler.sidecarimage=vanessa/fluence-sidecar \
  --set controller.image=vanessa/fluence-controller \
  --set scheduler.sidecarPullPolicy=IfNotPresent \
    fluence as-a-second-scheduler/
```

If you need to uninstall (e.g., to redo something):

```bash
helm uninstall fluence
```

Next you can move down to testing the install.

### Testing Install

The installation process will run one scheduler and one controller pod for the Scheduler Plugin Framework in the default namespace.
You can double check that everything is running as follows:

```bash
kubectl get pods
```
```console
NAME                                            READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
fluence-6bbcbc6bbf-xjfx6                        2/2     Running   0          2m35s
scheduler-plugins-controller-787757d8b8-ss5qv   1/1     Running   0          2m35s
```

Wait until the pods are running! You've just deployed Fluence, congratulations!
Let's now check logs for containers to check that everything is OK.
First, let's look at logs for the sidecar container:

```bash
kubectl logs fluence-6bbcbc6bbf-xjfx6 
```
```console
Defaulted container "sidecar" out of: sidecar, scheduler-plugins-scheduler
This is the fluxion grpc server
Created flux resource client  &{0x3bd33d0}
&{ctx:0x3bd33d0}
Number nodes  1
node in flux group  kind-control-plane
Node  kind-control-plane  flux cpu  10
Node  kind-control-plane  total mem  32992821248
Can request at most  10  exclusive cpu
Match policy:  {"matcher_policy": "lonode"}
[GRPCServer] gRPC Listening on [::]:4242
```

And for the fluence container:

```bash
kubectl logs fluence-6bbcbc6bbf-xjfx6 -c scheduler-plugins-scheduler
```

If you haven't done anything, you'll likely just see health checks.

### Deploy Pods

Let's now run a simple example! Change directory into this directory:

```bash
# This is from the root of flux-k8s
cd examples/simple_example
```

And then we want to deploy two pods, one assigned to the `default-scheduler` and the other
`fluence`. For FYI, we do this via setting `schedulerName` in the spec:

```yaml
spec:
  schedulerName: fluence
```

Here is how to create the pods:

```bash
kubectl apply -f default-scheduler-pod.yaml
kubectl apply -f fluence-scheduler-pod.yaml
```

Once it was created, aside from checking that it ran OK, I could verify by looking at the scheduler logs again:

```bash
kubectl logs fluence-6bbcbc6bbf-xjfx6
```
```bash
Defaulted container "sidecar" out of: sidecar, scheduler-plugins-scheduler
This is the fluxion grpc server
Created cli context  &{}

I was trying to look for a way to see the assignment, and maybe we can see it here (this is the best I could come up with!)

```bash
kubectl get events -o wide
```
```bash
kubectl get events -o wide |  awk {'print $4" " $5" " $6'} | column -t
```
```console
REASON                     OBJECT                                        SUBOBJECT
pod/default-scheduler-pod  default-scheduler                             Successfully
pod/default-scheduler-pod  spec.containers{default-scheduler-container}  kubelet,
pod/default-scheduler-pod  spec.containers{default-scheduler-container}  kubelet,
pod/default-scheduler-pod  spec.containers{default-scheduler-container}  kubelet,
pod/default-scheduler-pod  spec.containers{default-scheduler-container}  kubelet,
pod/fluence-scheduled-pod  fluence,                                      fluence-fluence-6bbcbc6bbf-xjfx6
pod/fluence-scheduled-pod  spec.containers{fluence-scheduled-container}  kubelet,
pod/fluence-scheduled-pod  spec.containers{fluence-scheduled-container}  kubelet,
pod/fluence-scheduled-pod  spec.containers{fluence-scheduled-container}  kubelet,
...
```

For the above, I found [this page](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/configure-multiple-schedulers/#enable-leader-election) very helpful.

Finally, note that we also have a more appropriate example with jobs under [examples/test_example](examples/test_example). It's slightly more sane because it uses Job, and jobs are expected to complete (whereas pods are not and will get into crash loop backoffs, etc). For example of how to programmatically interact with the job pods and check states, events, see the [test.sh](.github/test.sh) script.

### Developer

You can see [deploy](#deploy) for instructions on how to do a custom deployment. 

#### Organization

If you are looking to develop:

 - [src](src): includes source code for fluence. You'll find logs for this code in the `sidecar` container of the fluence pod.
 - [sig-scheduler-plugins](sig-scheduler-plugins): includes assets (manifests and Go files) that are intended to be added to the kubernetes-sigs/scheduler-plugins upstream repository before build. You'll find logs for this container in the `scheduler-plugins-scheduler` container of the pod.
   - [manifests](sig-scheduler-plugins/manifests): manifests for helm and Kubernetes
   - [pkg](sig-scheduler-plugins/pkg): the main fluence module to add to upstream
   - [cmd](sig-scheduler-plugins/cmd): the main.go to replace in upstream
 - *upstream*: the default name this upstream is cloned to when you do a make build command.

Note that the clone of the repository and copying of files to the correct locations is all automated through the [Makefile](Makefile). Additional commands provided include the following:

```bash
# Only clone the repository into ./upstream
make clone

# Update the cloned upstream with a git pull origin master
make update
```

It's recommend to update once in a while if you have an older clone locally and there might be changes you are not accounting for.

#### GRPC

The fluence module uses GRPC to communicate with Flux, and these assets are stored in [src/fluence/fluxcli-grpc](src/fluence/fluxcli-grpc).
You should *only* update the [sig-scheduler-plugins/pkg/fluence/fluxcli-grpc/fluxcli.proto](src/fluence/fluxcli-grpc/fluxcli.proto) file,
and then from the root run `make proto` to re-generate the other files:

```bash
cd src

# Install protoc tools to local bin
# make protoc
make proto
```

#### Workflow

The easiest thing to do is to build the containers in some container namespace that you control (meaning you can push to a registry), e.g.,:

```bash
make build REGISTRY=ghcr.io/vsoch
```

If needed, create a "multi node" kind cluster:

```bash
kind create cluster --config ./examples/kind-config.yaml
```

And then install with your custom images:

```bash
cd ./upstream/manifests/install/charts
helm install \
  --set scheduler.image=ghcr.io/vsoch/fluence:latest \
  --set controller.image=ghcr.io/vsoch/fluence-controller:latest \
  --set scheduler.sidecarimage=ghcr.io/vsoch/fluence-sidecar:latest \
        fluence as-a-second-scheduler/
```

And then apply what you need to test, and look at logs! 
And then keep doing that until you get what you want :) Note that I haven't found a good way for the VSCode developer tools to work because we develop fluence outside of the tree it's supposed to be in.

##### kubectl plugin

Note that if you want to enable extra endpoints for the fluence kubectl plugin and expose the GRPC as a service, you can do:

```bash
helm install \
  --set scheduler.image=ghcr.io/vsoch/fluence:latest \
  --set scheduler.enableExternalService=true \
  --set controller.image=ghcr.io/vsoch/fluence-controller \
  --set scheduler.sidecarimage=ghcr.io/vsoch/fluence-sidecar:latest \
        fluence as-a-second-scheduler/
```

For this setup if you are developing locally with kind, you will need to enable the ingress. Here is `kind-config.yaml`

```yaml
kind: Cluster
apiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
nodes:
- role: control-plane
  kubeadmConfigPatches:
  - |
    kind: InitConfiguration
    nodeRegistration:
      kubeletExtraArgs:
        node-labels: "ingress-ready=true"
  extraPortMappings:
  - containerPort: 4242
    hostPort: 4242
    protocol: TCP
```

And to create:

```bash
kind create cluster --config ./kind-config.yaml
```

#### Vanessa Thinking

> Updated February 15, 2024

What I think might be happening (and not always, sometimes)

- New pod group, no node list
- Fluence assigns nodes
- Nodes get assigned to pods 1:1
- POD group is deleted
- Some pod is sent back to queue (kubelet rejects, etc)
- POD group does not exist and is recreated, no node list
- Fluence asks again, but still has the first job. Not enough resources, asks forever.

The above would not happen with the persistent pod group (if it wasn't cleaned up until the deletion of the job) and wouldn't happen if there are just enough resources to account for the overlap.

- Does Fluence allocate resources for itself?
- It would be nice to be able to inspect the state of Fluence.
- At some point we want to be using the TBA fluxion-go instead of the one off branch we currently have (but we don't need to be blocked for that)
- We should (I think) restore pod group (it's in the controller here) and have our own container built. That way we have total control over the custom resource, and we don't risk it going away.
  - As a part of that, we can add add a mutating webhook that emulates what we are doing in fluence now to find the label, but instead we will create the CRD to hold state instead of trying to hold in the operator.
- It could then also be investigated that we can more flexibly change the size of the group, within some min/max size (also determined by labels?) to help with scheduling.
- Note that kueue has added a Pod Group object, so probably addresses the static case here.

#### Components

 - [FluxStateData](sig-scheduler-plugins/pkg/fluence/core/core.go): is given to the [framework.CycleState](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/242b41b36a20032f99e8a059ca0a5d764105217b/pkg/scheduler/framework/cycle_state.go#L48) and serves as a vehicle to store a cache of node name assignment.


#### Helm

The install commands are shown above, but often you want to uninstall!

> What is the name of the installed plugin again?

```bash
 helm list
NAME                    NAMESPACE       REVISION        UPDATED                                 STATUS          CHART                   APP VERSION
fluence  default         1               2024-01-08 12:04:58.558612156 -0700 MST deployed        scheduler-plugins-0.27.80.27.8     
```

And then uninstall:

```bash
$ helm uninstall fluence
release "fluence" uninstalled
```
